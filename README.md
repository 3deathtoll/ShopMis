# ShopMis

ShopMis, short for Shopkeeping Misadventures, is a text-based game.
Due to personal reasons I am putting this project on hold.

Warning. The source code is messy and needlessly complex. I use different patterns at different places.
I even wrote a [custom parser](lemonade/lemonscript.gd).

You are free to use the source code.
